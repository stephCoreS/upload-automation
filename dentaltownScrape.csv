Drug Interactions in Dentistry,Dr. Mark Donaldson,"Did you know that more than 20% of hospital admissions are due to adverse drug reactions? Just because dentists prescribe less than 10% of all available drugs, your patients may be taking others from the 90% with which you are not familiar. Since polypharmacy is the norm, especially in the over 65 year old population, this course should be considered essential to every practice setting today.

Do you have patients who are already on one prescription medication before they come to your office? How about four prescription medications? Did you know that the likelihood of a drug interaction in a patient on five medications is greater than 50%? What if you are the prescriber who writes that fifth prescription? With so many new medications, herbal products, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements available on the market, how can you be confident that the prescription you write is compatible with what your patient is currently taking?

This interactive program looks at some of the more common drugs and drug interactions and their management with a particular focus on the dental realm. Case studies will augment the delivery of key points and a problem-based learning approach is encouraged so that each participant’s questions are addressed.

50 Shades of Gray - Defining Radiolucency in Practice.,Dr. Parul Dua Makkar,"Correctly reading radiographs is essential in daily practice. As a dentist, reading an X-ray along with proper medical and dental histories, along with performing diagnostic tests helps narrow down the differential diagnosis of lesions. While not all radiolucencies need biopsies or referrals, knowing when and to refer to a specialist is imperative for the health of the patient and the health of the practice.

According to the CDC, in 2019, about 66 percent of adults had a dental visit within a 12-month period. Dentists are the ideal professionals to help screen for oral cancer. Oral cancer cases have been increasing in the past few decades and more than 54,000 cases are diagnosed every year in the U.S. The mortality rate is 50–90 percent within five years.

Guided Tissue Regeneration: Principles and Surgical Protocols,Dr. Giacomo Tarquini,"This course covers the Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) principles for the treatment of intrabony defects around teeth, which represent an anatomical sequela to the apical spread of periodontitis: GTR aims indeed to obtain an increase in the periodontal attachment level of a severely compromised tooth, a complete resolution of intrabony defects, a decrease in pocket depth and, finally, no or minimal decrease in gingival recession.

Detailed descriptions are given of both the biological rationale and the surgical protocol that underlie GTR.

Also, the diagnostic path and the multi-level prognostic factors evaluation are the subject of an in-depth discussion, as well as a detailed analysis of risk factors.

When it comes to the surgical approach, a detailed clinical flow chart leading to the right choice among the various techinques for GTR is presented and each surgical technique is showed following a “step by step” approach with the help of a large number of pictures and clinical videos.

Since GTR involves the use of barrier membranes, grafting of bone substitutes, and employment of biologically active regenerating materials (alone or in combination) a detailed regeneration strategy based on the properties of each biomaterial as well as the shape of the defect is addressed to help clinicians make informed choices.

Clinical potential and limits for Guided Tissue Regeneration compared with other surgical techniques as well as the role of Supportive Periodonta Therapy (SPT) are also discussed.

Testing Your HR Armor: How To Identify and Avoid Common Compliance Traps,Grace Godlasky,"Every year, lawmakers change dozens of employment laws and regulations at the state, federal, and local levels. As an employer, you must be compliant with ALL of the hundreds of laws that apply to you ALL of the time—or risk lawsuits, fines, and penalties.

Many practice owners assume that they're safe -- that their at-will status or existing office policies will protect them when the time comes. But at-will status is easily damaged, and your policies can only protect you if they're compliant with the laws that apply to your business. The thing is, most business owners don't even realize where they are vulnerable until a problem shows up at their doorstep and, at that point, it's already too late to do anything about it.

In this eye-opening presentation, CEDR Solution Center Manager Grace Godlasky reveals some of the most common HR compliance traps that practice owners miss and employers must proactively avoid.

Dental health care professionals must understand the environmental factors that have changed our commensal microbiota, driving this increase in food allergy. There is new guidance for infant feeding recommendations, based on randomized controlled trials regarding the prevention of food allergy. The USDA 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans include key messages that are relevant to the way in which we should be counseling dental patients regarding infant feeding as a way to prevent food allergy. This change in guidance has created uncertainty, confusion and fear among patients with regards to how and when to introduce allergens into a baby’s diet. Pregnant women and families with young children need guidance to help them navigate through the oral health care challenges and barriers faced when introducing allergens early.

However due to various reasons metal-ceramic, RBFDPs are not considered a comparable treatment modality to implants by most dentists.

Cantilevered anterior RBFDPs with a single ceramic retainer wing were introduced 25 years ago. They provide better esthetics and are less invasive than two-retainer RBFDPs. In the meantime long-term data with bonded zirconia restorations for this minimal invasive treatment option are available. Similar concepts are now also implemented for the replacement of posterior teeth that show promising medium-term outcomes comparable to single tooth implants.

Fees and returns are the primary way in which many business owners measure the worthiness of a 401(k) plan. Often, however, trust in the recommendations of a family member, close friend or longtime professional relationship impacts their choice in 401(k) provider — for better or worse. While fees and returns are important, there are many additional issues related to 401(k) management of which small business owners, including dentists, are generally unaware.

Herbal Interactions with Medications Commonly Used in Dentistry,Dr. Mark Donaldson,"Did you know that more than 20% of hospital admissions are due to adverse drug reactions? Just because dentists prescribe less than 10% of all available drugs, your patients may be taking others from the 90% with which you are not familiar. This is further compounded in patients taking complementary, alternative and natural therapies versus our traditional pharmaceuticals. Since polypharmacy is the norm, especially in the over 65 year old population, this course should be considered essential to every practice setting today.

Do you have patients who are already on one prescription medication before they come to your office? How about four prescription medications? Did you know that the likelihood of a drug interaction in a patient on five medications is greater than 50%? This risk continues to escalate in our patients also taking complementary, alternative and natural therapies. With so many new medications, herbal products, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements available on the market, how can you be confident that the prescription you write is compatible with what your patient is currently taking?

This program looks at the most common herbal interactions with those medications used in dentistry, and offers the safest approach in managing our most critical patient populations.

Setting the Tone: Guided Bone Regeneration Techniques,Dr. LeRoy Horton,"In a world of increasing life spans and an ever-growing popularity of dental implants, dentists increasingly encounter patients with edentulous sites and deficient bone who are seeking implant therapy. At some point in our career as implantologists, we go beyond the straightforward implant in the already-developed site, as well as the standard socket-preservation bone graft. Many of our patients have teeth extracted when a graft is cost-prohibitive or in settings where future implant placement is not a consideration. When this is the case, bone preservation or guided regeneration is not offered. They may then present with edentulous sites that are deficient not only potentially from the extraction process but also from shrinkage because of the time that has passed. This course demonstrates, via case presentation, some basic concepts in performing a single-site “onlay” graft to augment a deficient site. The generally accepted pillars of bone grafting are primary wound closure, angiogenesis, space maintenance and wound stability. I chose a scenario that I have found common in my specialty that will demonstrate all four pillars. This example of guided bone regeneration (GBR), when performed correctly with the right materials, can offer a high level of success for the future implant integration and stability of the subsequent restoration.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1066/setting-the-tone-guided-bone-regeneration-techniques,Implant Dentistry,PDF, $36,"Understand restorative-driven surgical strategies.

Fluorescence Enhanced Theragnosis™ in Cariology,Dr. Liviu Steier,"Bioluminescence and biophotonics are long established scientific disciplines which finally found acceptance and recognition in clinical dentistry.

Causality of the caries process has been identified as a combination of hard tissue dissolution and bacterial contamination. The physical presence of some of the caries pathogenic bacteria containing endogenous fluorophores can be visualized using high energy blue light. Once excited this internal fluorophore will emit light at a different wavelength which can be visualized and support the caries diagnosis process.

Successful bacterial elimination out of the hard tissue structure is today the major treatment approach for disease elimination. Visualization of successful bacterial decontamination favors a more conservative treatment approach securing and raising the success of minimal invasive dentistry allowing selective hard tissue removal and additional in situ disinfection.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1055/fluorescence-enhanced-theragnosis-in-cariology,"Imaging, CBCT, and Radiography",Video, $36,"Understand the scientific background behind Fluorescence Enhanced Caries Diagnosis.

As a business owner, you need money from patients to cover your overhead. Many patients see their financial responsibility as a hurdle and it’s a common reason they put off treatment. The majority of patient issues, and the main reasons patients leave dental practices, are often connected to money in some way.
Because a dental practice cannot survive without cash flow, it’s important to have the financial area of your practice well established with systems and a trained person making financial arrangements and collecting payments. Even if a doctor provides excellent dentistry, without a well-run financial department, the practice may end up with low treatment acceptance and patient acceptance, less-than-average collections, and a high number of upset patients and no-shows. It’s important to have the right person in the financial coordinator position—ideally, someone with interpersonal skills who can work with patients to create financial solutions so treatment is accepted and paid for.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1058/division-of-duties-in-a-dental-practice-part-4-the-finance-coordinator,"Practice Management, HR and Accounting",PDF, $36,"Create a financial coordinator job description and checklist.

Nitrous Oxide and Dental Personnel Concerns: Contamination & Scavenging,Dr. Mark Donaldson,"This course is specifically designed to mitigate any concerns dental staff may have when working in offices where nitrous oxide – oxygen inhalational sedation is provided. Perfect for every clinician, hygienist or team member who may be under the impression that the chronic environmental exposure to nitrous oxide could result in some type of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity in an expectant employee; this program debunks that myth.

This comprehensive review of animal studies, early non-clinical trials which led to the development of safer masks and scavenging systems and finally clinical trials which reinforce the wide margin of safety that this gas provides, this is a foundational course for all oral healthcare practitioners. As the late Dr. John Yageila is often quoted, “there has never been a death in a dental office, while dentistry is being done and nitrous oxide is the sole sedative being used.” We now know that this level of safety is not only imparted to our patients, many of whom may be pregnant, but definitely to our frontline workers who may be considering starting a family but are concerned about working in an office where nitrous oxide – oxygen inhalational sedation is provided.

Case studies will augment the delivery of key points and a problem-based learning approach is encouraged so that each participant’s questions are addressed. After all, if the oath we all took upon graduation was to, “First, do no harm,” then why would you not want to offer your patients and staff the best and safest treatment possible?",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1028/nitrous-oxide-and-dental-personnel-concerns-contamination-scavenging,Anesthesia and Pain Management,Video, $36,"Discuss the challenges with some of the early animal studies investigating the safety of nitrous oxide

Rapid Hypnotic Techniques for Drug-Free Management of Pain and Anxiety,"Elvira V. Lang, MD, PhD","Based on extensive clinical trials and clinic practice, this presentation builds on 25 years of experience with nonpharmacologic means of managing patient anxiety and pain in busy healthcare environments. It documents the effects of unaddressed anxiety on pain, the interconnected experience of the patient and dental practitioner’s stress, and the economic ramifications. It addresses how the natural upward trend of pain and anxiety during these encounters can be avoided, and the patient experience improved by slight, but reflective, changes in provider behavior and use of language. The audience will learn how to build rapport with their patients instantly, elicit positive behaviors and cooperation from them and their accompanying individuals. Listeners will be introduced to the powers of word choice, how they can avoid the adverse effects of negative suggestions, reframe distressing thoughts, fears, and worries, and moderate the effect of painful stimuli. Rapid hypnotic techniques will be described and demonstrated with a sample script. The specifics of language providing anxiety release and relaxation in the office, as well as those needed for additional pain relief, will be discussed and supplemented with findings from a recent clinical trial at Tufts Dental School.",1.25,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1048/rapid-hypnotic-techniques-for-drug-free-management-of-pain-and-anxiety,Anesthesia and Pain Management,Video, $36,"Rapidly establish rapport with distressed patients

The Role of Evidence to Inform Decisions in Practice. Why Bother with Evidence-Based Dentistry?,Dr. Romina Brignardello-Petersen,"This course aims to describe and illustrate the importance of evidence-based dental practice (EBDP). In the first part, the course explains why evidence is important when making decisions, what is evidence in general terms, and what is evidence in the context of dental practice. Then, the course presents, describes and explains the rational for the 3 principles of EBDP: optimal clinical decision-making requires awareness of the best available evidence, there is a need to judge whether the evidence is more or less trustworthy, and evidence alone is never sufficient to make a decision. While going through these principles, the course describes the concepts of hierarchy of evidence and limitations within levels of evidence, the importance of systematic reviews, and the role of patients’ values and preferences and clinicians’ experience when practicing EBDP.

"Division of Duties in a Dental Practice, Part 3: The Insurance Coordinator",Sandy Pardue,"Most patient issues in the practice are related to billing, which can cause low retention and are not good for the reputation of the practice. Because more Americans have access to insurance benefits than ever before, dental insurance is here to stay. Dealing with this service for your patients can be stressful if you don’t have the right processes in place and the right person managing it all. It’s possible to practice without accepting insurance policies, but you will be limiting your growth because patients expect you to file their insurance and help them understand their benefits. Some dentists have decided to outsource the insurance system to a third party to handle rather than confront it internally. Your goal should be to establish the insurance system as a service for your patients and consider it an opportunity to set your practice apart from others. Having an insurance coordinator who is trained on all processes and is available to and known by your patients is invaluable. Patients choose their dental practice based on their experiences more than the dentistry.

How Scanning Simplified my Dental Sleep Medicine Practice,"Mark T. Murphy, DDS, D. ABDSM","For some time now, dentistry has been progressing towards a more digital experience. Things like online marketing, registration, practice management systems, interoffice/patient communication, radiography, caries detection, intraoral cameras, surgical guides, shade taking, (you get the idea) have been moving to digital. Obstructive Sleep Apnea class II medical device manufacturers have been digital since inception. In fact, analog impressions and bite registrations had to be digitized prior to making your patient’s appliance. “Goop is Dead”, long live intraoral scanning! Especially for expensive PVS full arch impressions for dental sleep medicine, scanning makes great sense.

“This CE Course is a Gas!” Ensuring the Safe and Effective Delivery of Nitrous Oxide: Fail Safes,Dr. Mark Donaldson,"This course is specifically designed to mitigate any concerns dental staff may have when working in offices where nitrous oxide – oxygen inhalational sedation is provided. Perfect for every clinician, hygienist or team member who may be concerned about their chronic environmental exposure to nitrous oxide, or even patients who are fearful of receiving this modality, this program reviews the nitrous oxide delivery system safety features currently in use.

Surveys by the American Dental association and the Academy of General Dentistry demonstrate that the percentage of American dentists employing nitrous oxide – oxygen sedation is about 75 percent. The mechanics of nitrous oxide – oxygen delivery systems are differentiated commonly between two types of systems: either portable or fixed (plumbed in central system). Despite the large inherent margin of safety surrounding nitrous oxide – oxygen administration, at least 12 significant safety features have been developed to ensure the safe delivery of this gas regardless of the type of system employed. While manufacturers’ are initially responsible for making sure that these safety features are intact during production, the ultimate responsibility lies with the practitioner who chooses to utilize this delivery system in their practice. For this reason it is important for oral healthcare providers to be familiar with these safety features and how to maintain their integrity.

This program is comprehensive in its scope and will augment the delivery of key points with case examples to further enhance the learning experience. If the oath that we all took upon graduation was to, “First, do no harm,” then this is a must-take course for all.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1029/this-ce-course-is-a-gas-ensuring-the-safe-and-effective-delivery-of-nitrous-oxide-fail-safes,Anesthesia and Pain Management,Video, $36,"Discuss the twelve specific safety features inherent to all nitrous oxide – oxygen delivery systems

"Division of Duties in a Dental Practice, Part 2: The Scheduling Coordinator",Sandy Pardue,"Time is every practice’s most valuable asset and one of the most important systems in the practice is scheduling. The success of every dental practice starts with the schedule. It can create stress, or it can create great success. Practice owners would like to avoid roller-coaster production numbers, broken appointments, poor patient retention, and growing unscheduled treatment lists, yet they often fail to appoint someone to remedy these issues. Dental teams tend to be robotic when it comes to their schedule, putting patients on it without a plan and even without financial arrangements. When the team starts the day and learns there are holes in the schedule, it leads to the doctor having nonproductive procedures. As patients cancel and those slots are not refilled, production goals are not met. There will always be chaos and unpredictability when everyone on the team is overscheduling and no one person has been appointed to be the scheduling coordinator. Most practices have never set up security levels in their software, so anyone on the team can undermine the efforts of the scheduler and call patients to come early—or even cancel them as they see fit. Even after appointing a scheduling coordinator, the practice may still struggle if that person still wears other hats and is unable to focus on actions that align with the position, putting the schedule on the back burner when it should be the most important front-office function. Nothing else matters if the schedule is not full and productive.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1049/division-of-duties-in-a-dental-practice-part-2-the-scheduling-coordinator,"Practice Management, HR and Accounting",PDF, $36,"Recognize the benefits of having a designated scheduler.

Front-Line Work: Anterior Immediate Implant Strategies for General Dentists,Dr. LeRoy Horton,"As a young implantologist, I remember a lot of lectures seemingly created with the sole purpose of showing why anterior implants were too complicated for a general dentist. The cases presented were of beautiful people with picturesque alignment and gingival contours. The amazing results often involved a who’s-who of practitioners working as a team: a whiz-kid associate who was a master of dental photography, a surgeon who planned the surgical guide with the best software lab in the region, and a restorative specialist who went through five different provisional crowns before the in-house lab layered the porcelain numerous times on the final crown. Not many lectures opened up by telling the audience, “I’m here to teach general dentists the basic principles needed to achieve successful anterior implant therapies on your patients.” The protocol I describe is relatively minimal in nature and suitable for solo practitioners who are responsible for all aspects of therapy.

Implementing Teledentistry into Your Practice,"Maria Kunstadter, D.D.S.","The future of dentistry is here and now. Teledentistry can become a revenue-generating addition to your practice while improving patient care. Since Covid, virtual visits are now part of reducing viral exposures in the dental office. Virtual visits can provide the pre-covid screening, triaging emergencies and palliating non-emergencies to save valuable chair time and PPEs. With all the PPE requirements to treat patients, virtual visits will be the most personal contact patients will have with their dental team. To reduce the adoption barrier, it is important to remember teledentistry is nothing new. As soon as two people could talk to each other on the telephone, and one complained about a toothache, that was tele-dentistry-using telecommunications in the care, treatment, and education of dentistry. Healthcare providers have been providing telephone consultations ever since. Now, adding a video component to that conversation allows the doctor to see the patient and visually assess the patient.

It is important to define what teledentistry is and is not. Understanding synchronous, asynchronous, mHealth and tele-dental education is key to integrating into your practice model. Prior to Covid, a survey by DentVox in 2019 showed that 78% of patients are likely to start using teledentistry in the next 5 years. During Covid, payors stepped up and started reimbursing teledentistry, several provided teledentistry for their members at no cost to the member. States expanded their teledentistry regulations, allowing dentists to provide teledentistry to their patients. Now teledentistry is a household word.

Since Covid, virtual visits are now part of reducing viral exposures in the dental office. Virtual visits can provide the pre-covid screening, triaging emergencies and palliating non-emergencies to save valuable chair time and PPEs. With all the PPE requirements to treat patients, virtual visits will be the most personal contact patients will have with their dental team. The opportunity to “see” the dentist and staff free from masks, shields and protective gear will allow the interpersonal relationship to be established. Dentists who deliver services using teledentistry must establish protocols for appropriate referrals when necessary.

Estimated that 180M people will not visit a dentist office. Virtual Technology empowers patients to take control of their dental health by overcoming their biggest issue. Going to the dentist! TELEHEALTH USE IS UP 53% and growing faster than any other place of care. Teledentistry is the newest specialty.

Starting Off Right: Transform Your 'Receptionist' into a Director of First Impressions,Sandy Pardue,"Many may think of a receptionist as being someone who sits at the front desk smiling and serving coffee to patients, but it’s just not the case anymore. Patient expectations are higher than ever. Just “good enough” will not help you build or grow your practice. Patients are tuned in to online reviews and social media posts, and have elevated awareness when it comes to customer service. They know there are many dental practices that would welcome them, and unless you have created loyal patients through better-than-average experiences, they will think nothing of leaving. Because most dental practices have system failures or no division of duties, the teams tend to go through the motions throughout the day and handle only the obvious and immediate tasks right before them. There’s little time to focus on exceeding patient expectations, promoting the practice and improving customer service. Practices may think they are organized, but key actions get left undone. This creates many missed opportunities and inconsistencies, which adds stress and increases the number of patient upsets. When patients call your practice or enter through the front door, they are comparing their experience to every other dental practice they’ve called or visited. The receptionist of the past is now considered the director of first impressions and is a brand ambassador. Every practice needs one. The most obvious and immediate benefits are increased new patient numbers, more referrals and improved retention.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1034/starting-off-right-transform-your-receptionist-into-a-director-of-first-impressions,"Practice Management, HR and Accounting",PDF, $35,"Realize new opportunities with upgrading the receptionist position.

Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Beyond BONJ,Dr. Mark Donaldson,"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) can be difficult to treat and causes significant morbidity, but is largely preventable. Originally termed BONJ given the number of cases associated with bisphosphonate use, it is more commonly recognized as MRONJ today since the pathophysiology is due to two pharmacological classes of medications: antiresorptive (including bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors) and antiangiogenic drugs. Newly published guidelines strongly recommend dental assessment and necessary remedial treatment before such drugs are commenced.

MRONJ pathophysiology is still not completely elucidated. There are several suggested hypothesis that could explain its unique localization to the jaws: inflammation or infection, microtrauma, altered bone remodeling or over-suppression of bone resorption, angiogenesis inhibition, bisphosphonate toxicity, peculiar biofilm of the oral cavity, terminal vascularization of the mandible, suppression of immunity, or Vitamin D deficiency. Dental screening and adequate treatment are fundamental to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis in patients under antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapy, or before initiating the administration.

The treatment of MRONJ is generally difficult and the optimal therapy strategy is still to be established. For this reason, prevention is even more important. It is suggested that a multidisciplinary team approach including a dentist, an oncologist, and a maxillofacial surgeon to evaluate and decide the best therapy for the patient. The choice between a conservative treatment and surgery is not easy, and it should be made on a case by case basis. However, the initial approach should be as conservative as possible. The most important goals of treatment for patients with established MRONJ are primarily the control of infection, bone necrosis progression, and pain. The aim of this program is to present the current knowledge about MRONJ, its preventive measures and management strategies.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/998/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-beyond-bonj,"Oral Pathology, Pharmacology, and Cariology",Video, $36,"Describe the risk factors for osteoporosis to include the normal bone remodeling process

"From Simple Occlusal Adjustments to Treating Occlusal ""Neurotics""",Dr. Barry Glassman,"We have all dealt with a post restorative complaint and corrected it by adjusting a “high spot” that was inadvertently created during the procedure. Almost without fail a single adjustment resolves the complaint.

We have all dealt with patients who were hyper aware of their occlusion. Some of those patients get labeled as “occlusal neurotics.”

This CE course, then, is geared for the general dentist with the goals to improve daily occlusal adjustments in restorative therapy as well as to learn how to deal with more complex occlusal issues.

There is a continuum of disease that starts with a single tooth awareness that progresses to jaw discomfort and awareness that a bite is “uncomfortable” to a patient totally focused on their “bite” often seriously effecting the quality of their lives. The later stages of this disorder is termed “occlusal dysesthesia.”

There are many literature references to this somatic disorder. It is difficult to assess the frequency of the disorder. Because it is a continuum, many patients have a degree of the disorder and are therefore vulnerable to proceeding to a more serious, life altering form of the disease. The disorder is associated with a vicious cycle between an increased trigeminal signal and the reticular activating system. Appropriate treatment to interfere in this vicious cycle will be thoroughly explored.

What steps do you take when a patients says things like----

1. “My bite is uncomfortable.”
2. “I don’t know where to bite – I keep trying to find the right place.”
3. “I have two bites.”
4. “I was fine and comfortable, but after my bite changed with that bridge I am in pain and have headaches.



Do you ask your patient, “Do you grind your teeth at night?” After you adjust a restoration, do you have a a patient to tap their teeth and ask “How does that feel?

These questions can be problematic, and improved ways to assess the same information will be reviewed.

Occlusal dysesthesia (OD) can be a serious disorder that in some cases has been associated with long term mental illness and suicide. OD is not a genetic disorder, and we as dentists can not only prevent this disorder from becoming a serious negative force in a patient’s life but can also be responsible for its progression.

Only dentists can recognize and treat this disorder, and the treatment does NOT involve occlusal adjustments. This course will help the restorative dentist place occlusion in the proper perspective and clarify goals of therapy in terms of occlusion.",2.25,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/1024/from-simple-occlusal-adjustments-to-treating-occlusal-neurotics,TMJ and Occlusion,Video, $36,"Learn how to evaluate ""high spots""

Occlusal Equilibration: The Basics,Dr. Mike Racich,"Occlusal equilibration is a valuable aide for stomatognathic stabilization. Be it for restorative dentistry, prosthodontics, periodontics or orthodontics, the more complex the case, the more the maxilla-mandibular relationship requires physiologic, non-physiologic (e.g. bruxers), and static harmonization. Dentists, therefore, need to be able to provide occlusal equilibration services for their patients when required.

Simplify Composites,Dr. Dennis Brown,"Composite demands attention to detail but that doesn’t mean composites cannot be placed in a timely manner, be profitable and give the dentist pride in a job well done. The biggest challenge is maintaining isolation throughout composite placement. A rubber dam is considered ideal by many but it cannot always be used. The good news isolation can be accomplished without a rubber dam even in very difficult areas such as second molars.

Using a simple tofflemire a tight Class II contact is readily possible. If the embrasure space is wide and/or there is deep root decay, a tight contact can be fabricated with a tofflemire set up. Equally tight contacts on both sides of a MOD’s predictable every time. Again, accomplished with a tofflemire setup. Furthermore, all contacts described above made without the use of traditional aggressive wedging.

Factors such as age, gender, and medications play significant roles in correctly diagnosing this presentation. The subjective feeling of dry mouth is often referred to as xerostomia but may be more correctly diagnosed as salivary gland dysfunction: a reduced volume of saliva secretion or a change in salivary composition.

Symptoms of dry mouth may range from mild oral discomfort to significant oral disease that can negatively impact patients’ health, dietary intake, and quality of life. Despite the significant prevalence of xerostomia in the general population, however, no standard treatment guidelines exist. Successful treatments are typically individualized for the specific patient and should be targeted at the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. For these reasons, an accurate diagnosis of xerostomia is paramount so that patients may be offered the best treatment possible, and this treatment often involves a multimodal approach.

"The Tongue’s Role in Airway, Sleep, and Feeding Issues in Children",Dr. Richard Baxter,"Pediatric airway issues, sleep issues, and feeding issues are very common and often last into adulthood if left untreated. Early identification and treatment of these issues are critical to allow children to thrive and have normal growth and development. The dentist is well positioned to identify those at risk, and provide treatment or refer for treatment utilizing a team approach to care.

Many factors impact a child’s airway including enlarged tonsils and adenoids, a high and narrow palate, mouth breathing, and a restricted tongue (often referred to as tongue-tie). Often overlooked, a tongue-tie is likely one of the initial factors that can predispose children and adults to the other airway issues later in life such as mouth breathing, a high palate, and enlarged tonsils. It also can cause sleep, feeding, and speech issues in children. Thankfully, a tongue-tie is the factor that is most easily treated by the dentist with proper technique, planning, and follow-up. In this course, we will help you to identify patients at risk for a restricted tongue and airway issues, and teach you evidence-based strategies to manage these patients and treat them effectively.

We don’t want any children to have a negative quality of life from something that can be released quickly and with minimal trauma to the child and family.

Accessory Innervation Anesthetic Protocol,Dr. Daniel Uzbelger,"The inferior alveolar nerve block has the highest failure rate not only in dental local anesthesia but also amongst all local anesthetic blocks in medicine. The accessory innervation to the inferior alveolar nerve theory supports that the incidents of unsuccessful anesthesia may result from innervations of the adult mandible arising from the cervical plexus in addition to the auriculotemporal, buccal, mental, incisive, mylohyoid, and lingual nerves. Hence, to achieve profound pulpal anesthesia in the posterior mandible, an accessory innovation anesthetic protocol which anesthetizes all the accessory nerves has been clinically proposed. Three different accessory innervation anesthetic protocol approaches are described in this course as well as how to overcome pulpal anesthesia failure through the intraoral cervical plexus anesthetic technique implementation.

Transplanting Molars,Dr. Judy McIntyre,"For patients in whom a tooth is congenitally missing or lost to caries or trauma and when an appropriate donor tooth is available to fill the space, autotransplantation can be a predictable procedure that has been employed worldwide for more than 50 years with great success. Autotransplantation relocates one’s own tooth from its original position to another site. This recipient tooth site could have a tooth treatment-planned for extraction or may be a recent extraction site, or could be an edentulous site, or the site of a congenitally missing tooth.

This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of autotransplantation (AT); its treatment planning; a detailed sequence of the clinical procedure; and the criteria for the procedure’s success both pre- and postoperatively.

This unfulfilled niche in the marketplace should represent a great growth opportunity for every doctor. IV sedation offers a myriad of benefits to these types of patients and their treating doctors alike. Regardless if it is the glowing songs of “not even remembering being in the dental office” or “that was the best dental visit ever,” these are hymns of praise from the typical IV-sedated patient.

In the case of dentin, affected caries can remineralize as hydroxy or fluor apatite and infected dentin can remineralize as arrested caries.

Auto cure glass ionomer cements release fluoride and inhibit caries under a GIC restoration. These caries inhibiting properties can be enhanced by the prior placement of Silver Diamine Fluoride followed by Potassium Iodide to prevent the staining associated with SDF. This program explores the benefits pharmacological enhancements to remineralization.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/914/the-pharmacological-management-of-dental-caries,"Oral Pathology, Pharmacology, and Cariology",Video, $36,"Gain a further understanding of the nature of tooth decay and a tooth's ability to heal itself.

Composite Full Mouth Rehabilitations the dkdocterry Way,Dr. Terry Shaw,I have been restoring broken down dentitions with composite very successfully for over 30 years mainly due to the fact many of my patients simply could not afford conventional treatments with porcelain. I started out many years ago building up badly damaged single teeth and that worked well. It soon evolved out of desperation that I would do a whole arch usually lower teeth against an upper complete denture and that seemed to work well. The fact patients did so well with single arch rehabs I started doing both arches about 12-15 years ago and they have worked well. Many of my patients were older in their 60s and 70s and I have found they did well and were very appreciative that we could keep their teeth as many were advised by other dentists that their teeth were not restorable. Viewing this course will allow dentists to learn about an alternative treatment method to restore dentitions and save many teeth that traditionally would be lost since many patients can not afford porcelain.,2,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/810/composite-full-mouth-rehabilitations-the-dkdocterry-way,Restorative Dentistry,Video, $36,"Learn an alternative method of restoring broken down dentitions that would enable dentists to offer an additional treatment methodology

Accessory Innervation Anesthetic Protocol: From Research Theory to Clinical Reality,Dr. Daniel Uzbelger Feldman,"The inferior alveolar nerve block has the highest failure rate not only in dental local anesthesia, but also among all local anesthetic blocks in medicine. The “accessory innervation to the inferior alveolar nerve” theory supports the idea that incidents of unsuccessful anesthesia may result from innervations of the adult mandible arising from the cervical plexus in addition to the auriculotemporal, buccal, mental, incisive, mylohyoid, and lingual nerves.

Bone Graft Cements: A New Paradigm in Bone Augmentation,Dr. Amos Yahav,"Augmentation surgical procedures that combine implant placements have become an integral part of modern dentistry.

Appropriate placement of the implants according to the prosthetic requirements is essential for rehabilitative success. Therefore, clinicians are often required to perform augmentation procedures in order to be able to provide a solution. The diversity and complexity of bone lesions present challenges to clinicians, especially with existing bone substitutes marketed as granules, pastes, or blocks, which bring with them the need for stabilization by using membranes and fixating tools. As a consequence, high skill level is required as well as a long treatment time. To facilitate these operations, bone substitute companies are engaged in a constant search for the ultimate matrix that can bond their products, for preventing particle migration and obtaining the stability of the bone graft.

Use of cement bone grafts in the orthopedic medical field is state of the art , and have existed for years. However, in the dental field, the use of bone grafts cements is relatively unfamiliar.

Innovations in Endodontic Irrigation: Deciding What is Practical for Your Practice,Dr. Brett E. Gilbert,"The anatomy of root canal systems is a highly complex and convoluted space which presents a difficult challenge to fully cleanse.

Historically, the standard technique for root canal irrigation has been positive pressure needle irrigation into the pulp chamber and coronal third of the canals. Today, innovations in irrigation technology are available which allow a safer and more thorough method to flow solutions deep into the root canal systems.

Are You Staying Ahead of the Ultrasonic Curve?,"Dani Botbyl, RDH","Today, ultrasonic instrumentation goes far beyond the removal of calculus; when used as part of modern debridement strategies, it can lead to better resolution or reduction of oral inflammation. Despite the benefits of ultrasonic instrumentation, clinicians continue to rely on the technology to remove calculus and are much less focused on using ultrasonics to remove and disrupt biofilm. Research shows that dental hygienists are not maximizing ultrasonic instrumentation in their practices, which limits their ability to help their patients improve their oral and overall health. This article will focus on best practice standards that will help clinicians improve: the access or removal of biofilm and light calculus; the preservation of root structure; speed of treatment; and the wear rate of ultrasonic inserts and tips.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/822/are-you-staying-ahead-of-the-ultrasonic-curve,Hygiene,PDF, $36,"List four aspects of ultrasonic instrumentation design that affect the removal of deposit and the preservation of tooth structure.

Tongue-Ties and Lip-Ties – Treatment and Case Studies,Dr. Richard Baxter,"Tongue-tie is a very common condition affecting around 10% (or more) of the population. The controversial nature of tongue-tie is due to not having an accurate understanding of what it is, how to diagnose it, how it relates to common problems like nursing difficulties and speech issues, and how to treat it. There are also differing opinions about how to treat it by different disciplines from ENTs to pediatricians, dentists, speech therapists and lactation consultants. In this course, we will present the strong evidence supporting treatment of tongue-tie and lip-tie as it relates to breastfeeding, speech, and dental issues. The patient history, proper exam technique, making a diagnosis, and the research supporting treatment is discussed in detail in Part 1. It is critical to have a solid foundation of what a tongue and lip-tie are, how to recognize them, and the research that backs up the treatment before treatment should begin.
In this follow up course, Part 2, we will discuss treatment strategies, laser selection, a step-by-step technique, and a dozen clinical cases. There are many clinical videos to illustrate the technique with two different types of lasers (diode and CO2) that can be used to perform the procedure.

PPO Plays,Bill Rossi,"We believe that private independent practice is the best way to deliver dentistry. It’s best for the patients, the Doctors and the staff.
We further believe that sound management helps the Doctor thrive in a profession that is increasingly impinged on by Corporate Dentistry, PPOs, and other interests.
Through our ongoing work in helping to manage over 220 offices in the Upper Midwest area, and advise to Dentists across the country on “PPO Plays”, we have the information that helps level the playing field between the Dentists and insurance companies. It’s time for you to get your game on.
It is not unusual to see dental offices write off 10%, 20%, 30% and more of their production due to PPO participation. After staff expenses, PPO write offs are among the biggest “expense” that a practice can have.
PPOs are a reality of the current marketplace. So, the smart practitioner needs to know how to best deal with them. You have more power than you think you do. The right decisions here can add $1,000s to your bottom line and add greatly to your sense of control and security in the practice.
Whatever your situation is, there is no question that you will have to make decisions about joining and leaving PPOs. Making the right moves as you participate with PPOs ensure a healthy bottom line and practice independence going into the future.
This hour of CE will give you and your staff the basics you need to level the playing field with the “big guys” at the PPOs.

"Tongue and Lip Ties: Assessment, Diagnosis and Evidence for Treatment",Dr. Richard Baxter,"Tongue-tie is a very common condition affecting around 10% (or more) of the population. The controversial nature of tongue-tie is due to not having an accurate understanding of what it is, how to diagnose it, how it relates to common problems like nursing difficulties and speech issues, and how to treat it. There are also differing opinions about how to treat it by different disciplines from ENTs to pediatricians, dentists, speech therapists and lactation consultants.

Appropriate Analgesic Prescribing for the General Dentist,Dr. Mark Donaldson,"In 2010, Wouldn’t it be great to be known as the dentist who offers excellent pain-free, post-operative care without the use of narcotics? Wouldn’t you like to be more confident in all of your prescription writing, knowing that you are on the cutting edge, that you are evidence-based and that you are guideline-driven? This is that program. In 2010, enough opioids were sold to medicate each American adult at a dose of 5mg of hydrocodone every four hours for one month. In 2011, the number of overdose deaths from painkillers more than tripled over a decade - a trend that a U.S. health official called an epidemic. By 2012 the National Center for Health Statistics reported that, “prescription painkillers have now surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death in the United States.” You do not want to be part of this problem. Remember the Spiderman Principle that, “with great power there must also come – great responsibility.” Since pain secondary to dentistry is due to inflammation, and narcotics are not anti-inflammatory agents, opioid-containing analgesic agents should not be part of your routine armamentarium in managing postoperative dental pain. To this end, statewide electronic databases known as Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs track all controlled substance prescriptions and in many cases now require consultation by dental prescribers if an opioid containing analgesic is to be initiated on a patient.
By taking this important continuing education program you become a better prescriber and you will learn the ideal analgesic recipe to manage (almost) all of your patients pain: first time, every time. More importantly, this evidence-based, guideline-driven program will give you actionable material to begin implementing immediately. Given the renewed focus on the war on licit drugs, you do not want to become the target of any investigation into misprescribing and you certainly do not want to add to the current problem of opioid access and abuse.

Understanding the Mechanics of the MDA Appliance,Kay Gerety,"The MDA, Multi Distalizing Arch, is a fixed appliance for distalizing molars. This course shows how the appliance can be used for both the maxilla and mandible as needed with the non distalizing arch used for anchorage. It can be used on adolescents or adults as well as non compliant patients. The mechanics for the MDA are quite simple and easy to perform. There are dozens of appliances for distalization but we prefer to use the MDA for several reasons. It is rare that both sides will require the same amount of distalization and this appliance allows unilateral and bilateral distalization, even different amounts per side during bilateral use. We will demonstrate the technique for doubling the anchorage on the distalized arch which reduces the amount of compliance required. We will also introduce interarch springs that can be ligated in placed in the event of total non compliance. With good compliance, you will see a translation of all the posterior teeth which significantly reduces the time spent with finishing mechanics and we will show how to mechanically retract the teeth during distalization if the teeth are not translating.

We will show the technique and demonstrate how to adapt the MDA for initial seating, initial activation, seating and ligation procedures and periodic adjustments. For clinical application, you will see a completed case presentation of the MDA for correction of a class II dental case from beginning to retention.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/708/understanding-the-mechanics-of-the-mda-appliance,Orthodontics,Video, $36,"Select the proper size appliance

Lasers in the Management of the Apical Third of Root Canal Systems.,"Justin Kolnick, DDS","Successful management of the apical third of root canal systems has long been considered to be the most significant and challenging aspect of endodontic therapy. This is especially true in the treatment of apical periodontitis, where elimination of microorganisms is considered to be of the utmost importance for successful clinical outcomes. Significant, because the apical third contains the most important portals of exit of the root canal system to the periradicular area. Challenging, because it is the least accessible part of root canal systems with the most variation in anatomy, making cleaning and disinfection a daunting task. In addition, “successful management” needs to be achieved with minimal alteration to the original canal anatomy while maintaining tooth strength by preserving as much tooth structure as possible.
This lecture will review the importance and complexities of the apical third of root canal systems and will present a new, minimally invasive, laser treatment concept, Radial Apical Cleansing, for successful management of this critical area.

Busting the Myths of Occlusion... Practical Concepts For Everyday Dentistry,"Barry Glassman, DMD DAAPM, DAACP, FICCMO, Diplomate ABDSM","This two hour course clarifies many of the common myths of occlusion that is being taught and provides the ability to implement the reality based concepts to improve one’s ability to help each and every patient. Basic concepts are reviewed to help end much of the confusion associated with the term “TMD.” This is THE occlusion course that makes the lives of dentists easier by giving useful common sense advice. Basic TMD concepts in terms of joint anatomy and physiology and are reviewed so that common patient reports of pain and dysfunction can be more readily diagnosed and conservatively treated.
Dentists have spent much time, money, and effort in order to gain a greater understanding of these basic concepts, and in the end, often the result is increased confusion and frustration. Our goal in this two hour presentation is to take the information taught and put it all in some realistic perspective. Often times procedures may be successful for reasons that are different than that which we assumed, leading us to some form of confirmation bias of a particular concept. These two hours will make that process clear, and help you to apply evidenced based science to the empirical nature of our knowledge base of occlusion.",2.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/699/busting-the-myths-of-occlusion-practical-concepts-for-everyday-dentistry,TMJ and Occlusion,Video, $36,"1.

Mill In or Send Out?,"Paul Caselle, DDS","The challenges of obtaining traditional impressions that can affect the quality of the lab fabrication prosthesis include tooth position, patient tolerance for the material, and distortion of impression material because of technique or environmental factors.

Digital imaging can eliminate these factors, resulting in a more accurate prosthesis, which reduces chair time and increases efficiency since remakes are reduced. The ability to create a digital image with a capture device that can later be coupled with a milling unit allows the dentist the ultimate in versatility—the ability to provide “now” dentistry for routine one or two units.

Successfully treating our patients with fixed prosthodontics mandates we have a comprehensive understanding of not only materials, but also a mastery of mechanical concepts and a healthy respect for the remaining tooth structure.
There is no other field in dentistry where real improvement in outcomes can be directly attributed to attention to detail and execution.

Selective Root Retreatment: A Conservative Alternative,"William J. Nudera DDS, MS","Root canal retreatment is traditionally consider an “all or none” treatment approach. Meaning, all restorative and obturation material must be removed from the entire root canal space of all roots regardless of individual periapical health. In contrast, surgical endodontics is not viewed as an “all or none” approach. It is a generally accepted that only the diseased root(s) should be addressed via root end resection and root end filling. Knowledge gained from CBCT imaging has introduced a new reasonable treatment option for endodonticaly treated teeth presenting with post treatment disease. This new concept allows the clinician to make predictable treatment decisions based on the periapical status of an individual root(s) rather than make assumptions about the tooth as a whole. A “selective root retreatment” combines the approach of an orthograde retreatment with the selectivity of a retrograde surgical root resection. It is being suggested that retreatment could be limited to a single root or roots clearly demonstrating periapical pathology while leaving the root(s) with no visible or perceived pathology untouched.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/589/selective-root-retreatment-a-conservative-alternative,Endodontics,Video, $36,"Understand the current recommendations for root canal retreatment and associated risks.

Considerations for Treatment of External Cervical Invasive Resorption,Dr. Marco Maiolino,"Invasive cervical resorption clinically references an uncommon destructive and aggressive form of external tooth resorption. Diagnostically, external cervical invasive resorption (ECIR) lesions may appear as crestal or subgingival decay, or in erupting teeth as invasive coronal resorption, or even apically as invasive radicular resorption.

Numerous descriptors exist for this pathologic process: surface resorption, external inflammatory resorption, external replacement resorption, external cervical resorption, and transient apical breakdown. All are aggressive and problematic in regard to their clinical management. The more complex they become in regard to their location related to the epithelial attachment, the more difficult it becomes to reconstitute the resorptive defect.

Despite the odontoclastic nature of this pathosis, in many instances, there is no need to do root-canal therapy. This course is designed to acquaint the practitioner with the histopathology, diagnosis and treatment of ECIR lesions and enable him or her to differentially diagnose them from other similar lesions that require alternative treatment regimens.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/593/considerations-for-treatment-of-external-cervical-invasive-resorption,Endodontics,PDF, $36,"Correctly identify and diagnose ECIR

(R)Evolution of Bone Augmentation,Dr. Jan Kielhorn,"Bone augmentation is one of the most important and most difficult steps in implantology. The standard techniques used are very sensitive, and are bound to a certain experience from a large number of surgeries. They also have a high learning curve.
Despite these facts, augmentation procedures are often the least planned part of the therapy and based on poor diagnostics. Due to a lack of standardized protocols these procedures are often performed by the surgeons favorite method instead of the most indicated one.
It is astonishing, that for implant placement advanced techniques are used - cone beam, navigation templates etc. - whereas augmentation procedures are often based on a high percentage of improvisation.
3D diagnostics, the use of standardized protocols ( plug and play ) and prefabricated allograft materials do allow a reduction of treatment time and trauma for the patient by raising the reliability and success rate of this procedure.

Crooked to Straight: A General Dentists Journey Using Multiple Technologies,Dr. Paul Caselle,"In a general dentistry practice it is very common to see patients who have orthodontic relapse and want some esthetic correction, or patients who have never had orthodontic treatment but are interested in doing orthodontics now that they are adults. Typically many dentists would simply refer patients to an orthodontist or suggest veneers or crowns. However many patients are not receptive to shaving down perfectly good teeth to address their esthetic concerns nor prepared to undergo extensive orthodontic treatment. For some orthodontics is strictly cosmetic, however we know that crowded teeth can make it hard for patients to perform adequate homecare which can lead to tooth decay and periodontal problems. These patients are also candidates for short term or aligner type of orthodontics.
Many patients are also not concerned about their bite or back teeth, only that their front teeth are crowded and unsightly. Imagine if you could provide limited orthodontic treatment to your patients and complete necessary periodontal and root canal therapy as well as finish the case with in-office fabrication of crowns. Using available technologies can allow the general dentist to comfortably and confidently treat these patients making it a very rewarding experience for the patient and dentist. Transforming a smile is both rewarding and satisfying not only to the patient but also to the dentist. This course will illustrate how to treat a patient with several orthodontic treatment modalities that have protocols that eliminate much of the uncertainty of treatment and can actually make limited orthodontic treatment fun and rewarding.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/501/crooked-to-straight-a-general-dentists-journey-using-multiple-technologies,Orthodontics,Video, $36,"How to use technology in your office instead referring out to specialists

Endodontics in Depth: Modern Controlled Memory Navigation of Highly Curved Canals,"Dr.Chaniotis Antonis DDS,MDSc","The internal anatomy of human teeth consists of a highly complicated network of multi-planar curved, anastomotic canals, as seen in studies of root canal anatomy. Navigating efficiently, safely and predictably has been a matter of extensive effort and research over the years. The ultimate objective had always been the safe and predictable three dimensional chemo-mechanical debridement and obturation of the root canal system. However thorough instrumentation and enlargement of the apical region to achieve root canal disinfection has long been considered to be a crucial factor in the cleaning and shaping process. Greater apical preparations have the potential to more efficiently remove the debris and allow proper irrigation to the apical part of the canals. On the other hand, instrumentation with conventional rotary or reciprocating NiTi files to larger apical diameters, has the potential to generate cracks on the apical surface and induce dentinal damage and transportation in curved canals. Recently, a novel NiTi alloy with flexible properties called CM wire (Controlled memory wire) was introduced in the market. CM rotary files are extremely flexible and fatigue resistant, but without the shape memory of conventional NiTi files. The lack of shape memory effect and the superior flexibility of controlled memory files provide them the ability to follow the anatomy, reducing the risk of dentinal damage, even when larger apical preparations are required.
This course is designed to thoroughly discuss the potential of delivering larger apical preparations in extremely curved or double curved canal systems efficiently, safely and predictably by taking advantage of the controlled memory alloy properties.

"Bruxism: Completing a Joint, Muscle and Dentition Exam","Lee Ann Brady, DMD","Patients with bruxism have tooth wear caused by grinding and clenching. Both attrition and abfraction are specific types of tooth wear that result from grinding, clenching or power wiggling. This type of tooth wear can present alone, or as part of other signs and symptoms that fall under the umbrella of Temporomandibular Disorders. Understanding and treating TMD begins with assessing the stability and health of the joints, muscles and teeth. This program will explain the steps in completing a history and thorough clinical exam that leads to the next step, which may include treatment or additional diagnostics.
A joint exam is designed to uncover inflammation in the joint space and get a preliminary sense of the position of the disc in both rotation and translation. This information is gathered by acquiring a complete history with the patient and a clinical joint exam. Muscle signs and symptoms can be more elusive in a history, but by completing a muscle palpation, range of motion measurements and a load test are uncovered. The last step is completion of a functional exam to document the signs and symptoms of occlusal disease and record the patients existing functional occlusion.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/426/bruxism-completing-a-joint-muscle-and-dentition-exam,TMJ and Occlusion,Video, $36,"Describe the steps in a complete joint exam

The last thing we need is for the actual cementation process, try-in and veneer and tooth preparation protocol to add to this stress. Dr. David Hornbrook has mentored thousands of clinicians throughout the world on correct utilization of veneer adhesive systems and has created an efficient and predictable technique for bonding in anterior restorations entitled the “Tack & Wave” technique. This protocol is currently being taught at most of the major teaching centers and most post-graduate university programs. Join Dr. Hornbrook as he discusses Veneer try-in and selection of cements, adjustment of the ceramic during try-in, state-of-the-art adhesive systems, selection of cements, and proper finishing and polishing techniques. Also discussed and shown is the use of the AMSA injection for obtaining anesthesia for maxillary anterior teeth without lip anesthesia for predictable evaluation of the new smile by the patient before cementation.",2,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/393/tack-wave-veneer-cementation,Cosmetic Dentistry,Video, $36,"Easily try-in and adjust anterior veneers and crowns during try-in

Socket Bone Grafting Techniques using d-PTFE Membranes,"Anthony Reganato, DDS, MD","Dense PTFE is non-resorbable and chemically stable. In addition to its long history in the field of guided tissue regeneration, PTFE has been used for over 30 years in cardiovascular applications such as suture, vascular grafts and heart valves. PTFE is bio-inert and does not cause inflammation. If manufactured with a small pore size (0.3 microns), bacteria are prevented from entering the structure of the barrier while still allowing diffusion of oxygen and small molecules across the membrane. Upon implantation, dense PTFE is immediately coated with plasma proteins, facilitating cellular adhesion to the smooth, biocompatible surface. This cellular adhesion is observed to form a hermetic seal, providing resistance to migration of bacteria and epithelial cells around and under the membrane when it is exposed in the mouth. Plasma protein adsorption also facilitates diffusion of soluble organic molecules across the membrane. Removal of dense PTFE is simplified due to the lack of tissue ingrowth into the surface structure. The primary advantage of high-density PTFE is the ability to remain exposed in the mouth while protecting the underlying defect and bone graft. The membrane is soft, flexible and easy to handle. Primary closure is not required and the membrane may be removed without additional surgery if exposed. If primary closure technique is used, the membrane may be easily removed through a small incision in a flapless technique.",2.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/308/socket-bone-grafting-techniques-using-d-ptfe-membranes,Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,Video, $36,"Understand design principles of surgical flaps that facilitate placement and retention of d-PTFE membranes

Clinical Assessment of Implant Success or Failure,"Carl Misch, DDS, MDS, PhD (hc)","Implants are no longer the occasional means of replacing missing teeth. Whether they are used in conjunction with removable or fixed prosthetics, they are now the number one tool that dentists have to restore a dentition with one or multiple missing teeth. But how does one assess whether an implant has successfully integrated and is ready to restore? And more importantly how does one assess whether an implant with a restoration is doing its job and is clinically viable? In this comprehensive course, Dr. Carl Misch goes into detail on how to evaluate the success of an implant in your patient’s mouth. He describes what to look for clinically when doing patient exams to make this assessment with certainty. Both hygienists and dentists can go through a list of criteria and evaluate the results and know what steps to take depending on the results. Many examples of successes and failures are shown in this presentation from Dr. Misch’s case files to help one understand this important evaluation process. In addition, Dr. Misch describes how to avoid the most common reasons that implants fail.

This course is a must see for clinicians in dental practices that not only place or restore implants, but also for those dental practices that have patients that already have had implants placed.

Bruxism: Diagnosing Types of Tooth Wear,"Lee Ann Brady, DMD","Wear is a common problem we see in our practices. Deciding how to help our patients preserve their tooth structure and dental health depends on the cause of the wear. At the top of the list are attrition, caused by rubbing the teeth together and erosion where the teeth dissolve due to the presence of acid. Additionally we can see tooth wear from abrasion, caused by abrasive toothpastes and other oral hygiene products and abfraction, which is a loss of cervical tooth structure due to occlusal forces.

This program will describe the different clinical presentations that differentiate between the types of tooth wear. Determining which tooth surfaces are losing mass and showing signs of wear is a key first step to knowing the cause. Erosive patterns can occur on any tooth surfaces whether the patient can occlude there or not. Often these patterns are unique to the cause of the acid helping differentiate between GERD, Bulimia or Citrus Mulling. Attrition displays wear facets that are flat in character with the enamel and dentin being level, unlike erosion where the dentin disappears in depressions.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/425/bruxism-diagnosing-types-of-tooth-wear,TMJ and Occlusion,Video, $36,"Describe the clinical presentation of attrition

Posterior Single Tooth Replacement,"Carl Misch, DDS, MDS, PhD (hc)","Seventy percent of the population is missing one or more teeth. The traditional method to replace a tooth is a fixed partial denture. As a consequence of this device, the adjacent teeth decay almost 25% of the time. The pontic acts as a plaque trap and often causes decay at the crown margin next to the pontic. In addition, the abutment teeth of a fixed partial denture require endodontics for the decay or trauma of preparing the tooth almost 15% of the time. The endodontic treated tooth fails 10% of the time. In addition, the tooth may fracture as a result of the endodontic treatment. As a result of the decay or endodontics complications the abutment tooth is lost almost 30% of the time within 10 to 15 years. A dental implant to replace a missing tooth does not have to crown additional teeth and splint them together. The implant does not decay or need endodontic therapy. As a result, the implant and adjacent teeth last longer and are more predictable than traditional fixed prostheses.

Fundamentals of Veneer Preparation,Dr. David Hornbrook,"Being a pioneer in live-patient treatment courses, Dr. Hornbrook has mentored thousands of dentists chairside as they have prepared and placed porcelain veneers on their patients. The fundamentals of correct veneer preparation is something that is rarely addressed in dental school and even often skipped over in many of the cosmetic courses on smile designs and full mouth rehabilitations. A thorough understanding of how to correctly prepare the teeth for veneers is as equally as important as understanding ceramic materials and correct adhesive principles and improper preparation can certainly compromise the aesthetics and functional final results. Dr. Hornbrook has often stated in lectures that too many dentists “Prep and Pray” for a predictable result and do not take the time to design the smile and utilize this design to prepare teeth correctly. In this presentation, he discusses the use of a wax-up done by the laboratory and the use of preparation matrices to ensure predictable and repeatable results. He also discusses detailed preparation designs including correct margin placement, how to alter preparation with diastemas, and how to address existing Class III composites and interproximal caries.

Rationale for Implants: Complete Edentulism,"Carl Misch, DDS, MDS, PhD (hc)","The goal of modern dentistry is to return patients to normal function, esthetics, speech and health. The completely edentulous patient is more in need than any other patient. Yet, less than 3% of a dentists’ time is spent treating this section of the population.

There are 30 million people in the USDA that are missing some of their teeth in at least one dental study and 20 million people have no teeth at all. Once the teeth are lost, not only are function, speech and health reduced, there is loss of bone. The bone loss after tooth loss may be more than 20 mm in height of bone in each haw. As a consequence, facial esthetics is severely compromised.

Dental implants stimulate bone and prevent the gross bone loss after tooth loss. As a result, facial esthetics is maintained, since muscle attachments are not affected and atrophy of bone and muscle does not occur. Hence, dental implants not only return a patient to normal function and improved speech, dental and facial esthetics are vastly improved as a result of dental implants in the complete edentulous patient.

This program reviews the benefits of implant treatment for edentulous patients. The dental team should be aware of the consequences of complete tooth loss and the benefits of dental implants.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/383/rationale-for-implants-complete-edentulism,Implant Dentistry,Video, $36,"Understand and explain the effects of complete edentulism as they relate to aging population.

Historically, restorations have been fabricated to work within an ""envelope of function"". Remember, when we chew, teeth actually don’t touch. Given that fact, it isn’t during the envelope of function that teeth or restorations fail. Instead, it is when we extend beyond and into the ""Envelope of Parafunction"" that destruction occurs. If we can create restorations that exist within this envelope of parafunction, we have better opportunity for success. This presentation introduces the ""Outside/Inside"" evaluation.

Why We See Problems with Teeth Whitening: The Science of Whitening Part 1,"Rod Kurthy, DMD","Typical whitening systems are designed to provide what dentists and patients want, however these “wants” typically fly in the face of what is physically and chemically possible. For whitening success, tooth color molecules must be broken down by radicals produced by peroxide, however, there are a myriad of stumbling blocks to achieving this goal. With most current whitening systems, peroxide gels may already be degraded when received because of inadequate handling and lack of refrigeration by whitening product companies; gels may be chemically altered to lengthen shelf life, leading to acidic pH, higher osmolarity, higher sensitivity and less effectiveness of the products; and they typically have inadequate continuous activity to accomplish thorough cleansing and whitening of tooth structure. In-office whitening lacks the time necessary to thoroughly degrade color molecules, and antioxidants found in saliva and sulcular fluid rapidly seep under and into whitening trays, destroying peroxide on contact.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/302/why-we-see-problems-with-teeth-whitening-the-science-of-whitening-part-1,Cosmetic Dentistry,PDF, $36,"1.

Simplified Step-by-Step Layering Technique for Aesthetic Anterior Composite Buildup,Dr. Anthony Tay,"This article describes a simplified approach toward step-by-step layering of the anterior composite restoration. An understanding toward natural aesthetic from composite buildup and the ideal dimensions of individual layers will be presented. This will allow the practitioners to learn the skills required to confidently place anterior composite buildup in a conservative, aesthetic and predictable manner.

A common scenario that general dental practitioners face involves the rehabilitation of lost dental tissue in the anterior teeth. This can be in response to dental trauma from an accident or replacement of a defective restoration. With today's composite material in the dental market, it is possible to restore the lost dental tissue in a conservative and predictable approach. For this purpose, this presentation describes a simplified technique for such aesthetic anterior composite buildup. The individual steps will be described logically, including the layering details. To create surface anatomies that will mimic nature and lifelike aesthetics, the protocols for finishing and polishing will be given.

Understanding Color and Shade Matching in Dentistry,"Lane M. Ochi, DDS, FACD, FICD","This course is about how one uses color to get that perfect shade match. Color is an integral part of aesthetic dentistry. If the color of a restoration is off, the mistake can be glaringly evident and the result is an unhappy patient. Most dental schools do not do an adequate job in teaching color theory. Color theory is a language that conceptually and perceptually describes the elements of color and their interactions. Unfortunately, understanding color is tricky. Slight variances in shade play with our eyes, our minds, and, ultimately, our dentistry. The illumination in the dental treatment room, optical illusions, color blindness, and fatigue are among the dental professional’s ongoing obstacles to successful shade matching.

This course will enlighten the dentist and ceramist on the dimensions of color, the effect of metamerism and other phenomenon using actual examples from Dr. Ochi's own cases. By being fluent in the language of color, we can sharpen our perception of color, better understand existing color dynamics, make better predictions, and communicate more clearly about color.

The Digital Restorative Model,"Todd Ehrlich, DDS, FAGD","The computerization of our society has definitely penetrated the dental industry and has an impact on material selection and efficiency. A popular dental material, zirconia, may only be made digitally. Although dentists continue to send physical impressions to their dental labs for these restorations, they must be digitized to allow for the CAD/CAM application of zirconia. With this process, a digital model is required.

If the doctor initiates the process with a digital optical scan, rather than a physical impression, the information can be analyzed by the doctor for preparation quality. This is done during the scanning process and prior to uploading the information through the Internet to their lab. Subsequently, the lab can use the digital model for restoration fabrication in a timely fashion. With modern tooth modeling algorithms and tools, the design process for the prosthesis is quickly rendered. Therefore, the restoration can be made efficiently and the patient can be delighted with the high-tech feel for the process.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/277/the-digital-restorative-model,CAD-CAM,PDF, $36,"1.

No Longer Just a Prophy,"by Debra Seidel-Bittke, RDH, BS","A prophylaxis is reserved for healthy patients with no signs of periodontal disease. The need for more than 20 minutes of subgingival instrumentation during a prophylaxis appointment shifts the focus from health to periodontal disease. Periodontal disease might be overlooked during a prophylaxis because of four reasons: improper probing technique, insurance roadblocks, unclear practice philosophy and financial profiling. To avoid providing periodontal therapy during a prophylaxis, a three-step plan of action should be followed. This plan includes periodontal assessments, discussing the findings with the patient and taking the time to explain to the patient the treatment that is needed. Understanding the reasons periodontal disease might be overlooked and following a plan of action when periodontal disease is present will assure that prophy appointments do not include unplanned periodontal instrumentation.",1.5,https://www.dentaltown.com/onlinece/details/278/no-longer-just-a-prophy,Periodontics,PDF, $36,"1.

Inman Aligner - Rapid Anterior Orthodontics Simplified!,"Tif Qureshi, BDS","The Inman Aligner has been described in Europe as the missing link between orthodontics and cosmetic dentistry - It is widely used throughout Europe and is now coming to the US as a standalone treatment or in combination with bleaching and bonding or even veneers to produce beautiful smiles in an ethical non destructive way. The lecture will cover some of the detailed operational techniques, introduce the concept of progressive interproximal reduction, anchor placement techniques that can rapidly increase the efficiency of the system. The Inman Aligner is removable, only worn 16 -18 hours a day and most treatments take less than twelve weeks meaning it is often chosen by many patients who would normally be put off by fixed orthodontics. The lecture will also introduce the concept of Progressive Smile Design (tm) where a patient gradually chooses the pathway of treatment and can assess at each stage with less risk.
Tif will show how in a period of only 2 - 3 months how simple alignment, whitening and bonding incisal edges can harmonize the anatomy to provide a totally non-invasive smile makeover that challenges a traditional veneer makeover without the risks - All done with no an-aesthetic or tooth preparation.
The presentation will cover:
- Intro and philosophy
- Modern usage of the Inman Aligner
- Case selection and treatment limitations
- Alignment Bleaching Bonding- a procedure to take straight back into your practice
- Simple and complex cases
- Pre-alignment cases before veneers.

Safeguards To Prevent Embezzlement,Sandy Pardue,"Embezzlement is a sad reality and a crime of opportunity. It is a lot more common than most dentists realize. The reality is that once someone has decided to stick their hands in YOUR pocket, they are now thinking about how they will pull it off. You are busy with patients and they are helping themselves to YOUR hard earned money. You think it couldn't happen to you? Think again. Per the American Dental Association, surveys reveal that 35 percent of dental practices have been embezzled once, and 17 percent have been victims more than once. These are only the practices that we know about. Dishonest employees have the advantage in your practice. They know you and they know what practice monitors you are watching, if any.

Disinfection and Sterilization: A Primer,"Margaret Scarlett, DMD","This lecture contains a practical, rational and economical approach to instrument processing and sterilization and disinfection in the dental office. The variety of new products and materials available in dentistry increases every day. Rather than a discussion of how each of these should be disinfected and sterilized, this lecture focuses on determining what to do by how to the items are used in patient care. In addition to discussion of categorization of patient care items and sterilization techniques, practitioners are guided through a discussion of types of germicidal products. These should be evaluated carefully.

In general, choosing the right germicidal product is important. What you choose in a germicidal agent depends on a number of factors, such as the nature of the contamination (meaning the organic material such as whether it is blood or saliva), the amount of the contamination present, the type of germicide used and whether it is sporicidal or tuberculocidal.
